# Obstacle-Avoiding-Bluetooth-Controlled-Robotic-Car
Body Designed using AutoCAD and Fusion 360<br/>
3D printed at Maker's Lab, and Coded with Arduino IDE<br/>
# Abstract
In this project, the Bluetooth controlled robotic car, is a robot controlled by the user using an android application acting as a remote for the robot. The application contains touch buttons to control the car in forward, backward, left, and right directions. The userâ€™s phone is used as a transmitting device and the Bluetooth module used here (HC-05) is used as a receiver. The body of the robot was designed using AutoCAD and exported to a 3D model using Fusion 360 software, further, was 3D printed at our lab. The controller used is Arduino UNO which is easy to use and compatible with the LDR used, and also compatible with the motor driver L298D which is used to control the dc motors. This robot can detect obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, and also switch on LEDs according to LDR sensor results.
