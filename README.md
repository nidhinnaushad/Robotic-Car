# Robotic-Car
Body of the robot was designed using AutoCAD & Fusion 360<br/>
3D printed at Hut Labsv, and programmed using Arduino IDE<br/>
# Abstract
Arduino UNO is used as the microcontroller along with a motor driver L298D to control the movement and it can communicate via bluetooth using HC-05 module. 
Added features of this robot include obstacle detecting, implemented using an unltrasonic sensor, and light detecting leds implemented using a photoresistor. A simple button based application that can be installed in our phones is used as the remote to control the robotic car and PWM signals can be used to control the speed of the robotic car.
